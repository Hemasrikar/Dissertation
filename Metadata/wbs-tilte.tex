    \textbf{Academic Integrity Declaration:}

    \begin{footnotesize}
    \paragraph{}
    We're part of an academic community at Warwick. Whether studying, teaching, or researching, weâ€™re all taking part in an expert conversation which must meet standards of academic integrity. When we all meet these standards, we can take pride in our own academic achievements, as individuals and as an academic community.

    Academic integrity means committing to honesty in academic work, giving credit where we've used others' ideas and being proud of our own achievements.

    In submitting my work, I confirm that:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
        \item I have read the guidance on academic integrity provided in the Student Handbook and understand the University regulations in relation to Academic Integrity. I am aware of the potential consequences of Academic Misconduct.
        \item I declare that the work is all my own, except where I have stated otherwise.
        \item No substantial part(s) of the work submitted here has also been submitted by me in other credit bearing assessments courses of study (other than in certain cases of a resubmission of a piece of work), and I acknowledge that if this has been done this may lead to an appropriate sanction.
        \item Where a generative Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT has been used I confirm I have abided by both the University guidance and specific requirements as set out in the Student Handbook and the Assessment brief. I have clearly acknowledged the use of any generative Artificial Intelligence in my submission, my reasoning for using it and which generative AI (or AIs) I have used. Except where indicated the work is otherwise entirely my own.
        \item I understand that should this piece of work raise concerns requiring investigation in relation to any of points above, it is possible that other work I have submitted for assessment will be checked, even if marks (provisional or confirmed) have been published.
        \item Where a proof-reader, paid or unpaid was used, I confirm that the proof-reader was made aware of and has complied with the University's proofreading policy.
    \end{itemize}
