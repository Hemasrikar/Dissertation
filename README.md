# Dissertation-Template
MSc Mathematical Finance Dissertation Template. Decided to make a template of my own for Master's Thesis to add personal touch instead of the same old thesis template provided by the uni, which probably will be used by everyone in the class. 

This template makes use of elements from the following LaTeX templates:

- **[TU Delft Report Thesis](https://github.com/dzwaneveld/tudelft-report-thesis-template)** – original template by Daan Zwaneveld, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.  

- **[Ipleiria Thesis](https://github.com/joseareia/ipleiria-thesis)** – original template by José Areia, licensed under LPPL 1.3c.

Modifications have been made for personal use. Original license notices have been preserved where applicable.
